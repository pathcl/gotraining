### Ultimate Go

The Advanced Ultimate Go class is designed to focus on digging deep into the language to understand the internals that matter and the semantics. The course is about if performance matters then these things matter. This is presented from focusing on code readability at a micro level to full application architecture and development.

We will talk about semantics, guidelines, mechanical sympathy and data oriented design. We are going to talk about package oriented design and how to structure your Go projects for the long term.

### Ultimate Service

The Ultimate Service is a 3 day class for any Go developer who wishes to learn how to build production ready and well tested web services in Go. This class provides an intensive, comprehensive and idiomatic view of building web services using community accepted idioms and practices.

The class goes beyond just the use of the http package and focuses on building CRUD based services with logging, observability and debugging. The class also teaches POD architectures, Docker and cloud deployment. We believe this class is perfect for anyone wishing to build production ready, scalable, fast, and highly concurrent web services in Go.
