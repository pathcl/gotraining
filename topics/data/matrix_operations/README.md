## Matrix Operations, Linear Algebra

As mentioned, matrix operations are ubiquitous in the data science world.  Most machine learning algorithms and many statistical/modeling techniques rely on iterative matrix operations including solving for eigenvalues/vectors, finding determinants, taking transposes, and more.  We will highlight a few here, such that you can have confidence in implementing your own custom models and understand various pre-existing implementations.

## Notes

- Matrix multiplication is in general not commutative.
- Many of the familiar rules for arithmetic with numbers hold in the case of matrix arithmetic.
- "Eigenvectors are a special set of vectors associated with a linear system of equations (i.e., a matrix equation) that are sometimes also known as characteristic vectors, proper vectors, or latent vectors... Each eigenvector is paired with a corresponding so-called eigenvalue" from [Wolfram Mathworld](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Eigenvector.html).
- A norm is a function that assigns a strictly positive length or size to a vector or matrix.

## Exercises

### Exercise 1

Divide the following matrix by its norm:


    a = ⎡1  2  3⎤
        ⎢0  4  5⎥
        ⎣0  0  6⎦
