## Dimensionality Reduction

Data scientists use dimensionality reduction to transfrom high-dimensional data sets into more compact, low-dimensional data sets.  This process can be very useful when there is redundancy and correlation between features, when a data set includes irrelevant features, and when computational or modeling constraints necessitate lower dimensions. Principal Component Analysis is a widely used dimensionality reduction technique that we will explore here.

## Notes

- Principal components are (as stated [here](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/)):
    - a sequence of projections of the data, 
    - mutually uncorrelated, and 
    - ordered in variance.
- The axis corresponding to the principal eigenvector/component is the one along which the data is most “spread out” (i.e., the axis along which the variance of the data is maximized).
- A PCA transformation, replaces high-dimensionality data by its projection onto it's most important axes.
- Although PCA is widely used, there are a variety of dimensionality reduction techniques
