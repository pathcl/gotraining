## Ultimate Go

This class has been designed over the past 3 years and goes beyond just being a language class. There will be very little teaching of syntax and a big focus on learning how to read and understand the code you are writing. With a big understanding of “if performance matters” then these things matter. We will talk about semantics, guidelines, mechanical sympathy and data oriented design. We are going to talk about package oriented design and how to structure your Go projects for the long term. We are going to talk about writing concurrent code and how to effectively use channels. Then I will dig into the testing, benchmarking and profile tooling. We will talk a lot about composition and design.

Everyone is going to be mentally exhausted by the end of each day. We will be challenging every student to think about what they are doing and why. In the 3 years we have taught this material, we never had someone not appreciate the class and feel like they are a better developer for it. If you want your team to be better Go developers, code reviewers, designers and architects, this is the class they need.

*Note: This material has been designed to be taught in a classroom environment. The code is well commented but missing some of the contextual concepts and ideas that will be covered in class.*

## Language Mechanics

This material covers all the language syntax, idioms, implementation and specification of the language. Once you are done with this material you will understand the mechanics of the language and mechanical sympathies the language has for both the hardware and operating system. 

[Language Mechanics](language/README.md)

## Software Design

This material covers the essential things you need to know about designing software in Go. Along the way you also learn about composition and error handling.

## Concurrency

This material covers all the concurrency aspects of the language. Once you are done with this material you will understand the concurrent mechanics of the language and mechanical sympathies the language has for both the hardware and operating system as it related to concurrency.

## Testing and Profiling

This material covers a good portion of the tooling that comes with go. Specifically we cover testing and benchmarking. We also cover profiling memory and the scheduler. Finally we learn how to read stack traces.

## Packages

This material covers the essential things you need to know about the standard library and some important third party packages. Along the way you also learn about the most commonly used packages.
